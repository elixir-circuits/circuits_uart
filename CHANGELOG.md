# Changelog

## v1.2.1

* Bug fixes
  * Added missing ignore parity option to parity checking choices
  * Fix compiler warnings when built using newer versions of gcc

## v1.2.0

* Improvements
  * Added `id: pid` option. In active mode, this causes the receive
    notification messages to contain the pid of the Nerves.UART GenServer that
    sends them. Thanks to Tallak Tveide for this improvement.
  * Added `find_pids/0` diagnostic utility for finding lost `Nerves.UART` pids.
    This is handy when you need to close a serial port and don't know the pid.
  * Added `configuration/1` to get the current configuration of a UART.

## v1.1.1

The mix.exs file has the Elixir requirement bumped from 1.3 to 1.4. This was
done to fix a Dialyzer warning caused by a change in arguments to
`System.monotonic_time/1` with newer versions of Erlang and Elixir.
Unfortunately this broke compilation under Elixir 1.3.

  * Bug fixes
    * Removed unnecessary open failure notification message. The failure gets
      returned from the open call already and the notification was due to an
      unfortunate path through the Linux filehandle polling code.
    * Various Windows fixes:
      * Fixed unhandled tx ready event seen during big transfers at 250000.
        Thanks to Arne Ehrlich for figuring this out.
      * Fixed bogus file handle errors when an open fails and then an attempt to
        open again happens without a restart of the GenServer.

## v1.1.0

  * Improvements
    * Added 4-byte framer both since it is periodically useful and as a very
      simple example of the framing feature.

  * Bug fixes
    * Fix active mode state not being updated and a message being sent in
      passive mode on an open failure.
    * Maintain the elapsed time on passive mode reads to avoid reading forever
      when bytes keep arriving, but no messages get sent from the framer

## v1.0.1

  * Improvements
    * Refactored Makefile logic to avoid 1-2 second hit when building. This was
      due to erl being called to get the directory containing the erl interface
      include/lib paths. Now mix.exs passes them down.
    * Trivial Elixir 1.6 formatting tweaks

## v1.0.0

  * Bug fixes
    * Flush framing when closing a port
    * Fix broken spec's
    * Documentation and code cleanup

## v0.1.2

Prebuilt port binaries are no longer distributed in hex.pm for Windows users.
You'll need to install MinGW. Feedback was that it didn't work as well as I
thought it would.

  * Bug fixes
    * Fix custom baudrates not working on OSX. Thanks to salzig for identifying
      the problem and helping to debug it.
    * Pass flush request through to framer as well as the serial port
    * Minor code cleanup

## v0.1.1

  * New features
    * Enable experimental feature on Windows to use prebuilt
      port binary. Feedback appreciated.

## v0.1.0

  * New features
    * Add support for adding and removing framing on data
      transferred over the serial port.
    * Add line framing implementation to support receiving
      notifications only for complete lines (lines ending
      in '\n' or '\r\n') or lines that are longer than a set
      length.

  * Bugs fixed
    * Enable RTS when not using it. Keeping it cleared
      was stopping transmission on devices that supported
      flow control when the user wasn't using it.
    * Fix quirks on Windows when using com0com. This should
      improve support with at least one other serial driver
      based on user error reports.

  * Known limitations
    * Framing receive timeouts only work in active mode.
      (I.e., you're waiting for a complete line to be received,
      but if it takes too long, then you want to receive a
      notification of a partial line.) Passive mode support is coming.

## v0.0.7

  * Bugs fixed
    * Force elixir_make v0.3.0 so that it works OTP 19

## v0.0.6

    * Added support for sending breaks
    * Added support for specifying which queue to flush
      (:receive, :transmit, or :both)

  * Bugs fixed
    * Fixed crash in active mode when sending and receiving
      at the same time

## v0.0.3

  * Bugs fixed
    * Crosscompiling on OSX works now

## v0.0.2
